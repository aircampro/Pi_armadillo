# Reading IR signal from Mitsubishi AC IR hand-held controller
# and sending this signal, every IR is different so you will need to check with the handheld 
#
# uses pigpio so you must install and have daemon running
# $ sudo apt update
# $ sudo apt install pigpio python-pigpio -y
# $ sudo systemctl start pigpiod
#
# $ curl http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/code/irrp_py.zip | zcat > irrp.py
#
# use this to record each IR command e.g Temperture to 26, Temperture to 27 etc
# python3 irrp.py -r -g18 -f codes --no-confirm --post 50 ac:cool27
# the last argument is for example cool 27 deg C - what you command from handheld to the AC
# 
# -r Mode of recording the received signal
# -g18 Receiving signals using GPIO18
# -f codes	Specify the file name to output the received signal.
# --no-confirm	Don't ask for the same signal twice for confirmation
# --post 50	If there is no signal for 50 ms, it is judged that the signal is over.
# ac:cool27	The identifier of the signal. Give it a descriptive name
# result is a list of timed pulses
#
# decodes in AEHA or NEC format please check for SONY
#
# $ python3 decode.py -f codes ac:cool27
